For far too long I haven't written down things, that are sometimes hard to remember or experiences that are fleeting because they are only in your memory. I hope that this journal will be something that I occasionally fill with such experiences.

Heading down different projects might lead to insight that wasn't available before and knowledge based on books rather than usage in projects. This journal should be a place to reflect on decisions either good or bad.

*Far too optimistic this will last*,
